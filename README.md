## üîç Overview

This reference implementation demonstrates how to:

- Combine **LangGraph** for compositional agent graphs  
- Leverage **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for standardized tool/context integration  
- Employ **Ollama** & **HuggingFace** models for domain‚Äêspecific intelligence  

‚Ä¶to build **production-grade, goal-driven** AI systems with:

- Fine-grained task decomposition  
- Context-aware reasoning  
- Event-driven, asynchronous coordination  
- Human-in-the-loop feedback loops  

---

## üß¨ What is AgenticAI?

AgenticAI describes systems where:

- **Autonomy**: Agents independently plan and execute subtasks  
- **Orchestration**: Workflows are coordinated via a shared protocol (MCP)  
- **Composability**: Agents and graphs are modular, reusable, and testable  

These systems extend beyond classic Generative AI by providing **stateful**, **goal-oriented** workflows across multiple collaborative agents.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Components

- **LangGraph**  
  Build and visualize multi-agent workflows as directed graphs.  

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**  
  A JSON-RPC‚Äìstyle standard for exposing tools, data sources, and context to LLM-powered agents.  

- **Ollama**  
  High-throughput LLM serving for on-premise or cloud deployments.  

- **HuggingFace Models**  
  Domain-tuned transformers for specialized reasoning tasks.

## üß† GenAI vs AgenticAI

| Feature                    | Generative AI (GenAI)                                                    | Agentic AI                                                                 |

| **Control Flow Logic**     | Determined by prompt engineering                                        | Driven by finite-state machines, graphs, or reactive policies             |
| **Memory & State Handling**| Typically ephemeral (no memory or limited through hacks like RAG)       | Persistent, structured memory for state tracking and dependency handling  |
| **Interactivity Level**    | Low‚Äîrequires repeated user input                                        | High‚Äîagents plan, recover from failure, and reattempt subtasks            |
| **Tool Use & API Calling** | Manually scripted via code or prompt templates                          | Dynamically selected tools via agent/tool registries and MCP mechanisms   |
| **Adaptability**           | Fixed behavior per prompt configuration                                 | Context-aware adaptation based on task state and environment              |
| **Scalability**            | Scaling limited by model size and prompt length                         | Scales horizontally by orchestrating multiple specialized agents          |
| **Debuggability**          | Opaque reasoning; difficult to trace                                    | Transparent workflows; traceable node-level decisions                     |
| **Learning/Training**      | Pretrained foundation models; static behavior                           | Potential for online learning, fine-tuning per agent                      |
| **Security/Guardrails**    | Prompt filtering, static constraints                                    | Embedded policies, role-based access, task-level validation               |
