    "### 🧱 **Stage 1: Simple LLM-based Chatbot (Basic Generative AI)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 👩‍💼 **Scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "An HR recruiter wants to hire a **Backend Engineer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🤖 **How GenAI Helps (Task-Based):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 📝 **JD Drafting:** Generates a generic job description from recruiter prompts.\n",
    "* 🌐 **Platform Suggestion:** Recommends job portals (e.g., LinkedIn, Naukri.com).\n",
    "  ➡️ *Manual posting by human.*\n",
    "* 🕵️ **Candidate Shortlisting Tips:** Gives basic suggestions (e.g., \"look for Python/Cloud skills\").\n",
    "  ➡️ *Resume screening done manually.*\n",
    "* 📧 **Interview Email Drafting:** Provides a sample invite email.\n",
    "  ➡️ *Human sends it.*\n",
    "* ❓ **Interview Question Bank:** Produces a generic list.\n",
    "* 📃 **Offer Letter Drafting:** Creates a simple template.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚠️ **Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🔁 **Reactive:** The chatbot only responds; human drives the flow.\n",
    "2. 🧠 **No Memory:** Lacks context-awareness.\n",
    "3. 📄 **Generic Output:** Responses aren't personalized to the company's style or needs.\n",
    "4. 🚫 **No Action Capabilities:** Can’t perform tasks like posting jobs or sending emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 **Stage 2: RAG-based Chatbot (Smarter Generative AI)**\n",
    "\n",

    "* 🧠 No memory or understanding of broader context.\n",
    "* 🔧 Cannot **adapt** dynamically when issues arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤖 **Stage 4: Agentic AI (The Goal)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 **Key Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ⚡ **Proactive:** Takes initiative without needing constant prompts.\n",
    "2. 🧬 **Memory + Context Awareness:** Remembers past steps, understands the full process.\n",
    "3. 🔄 **Adaptability:** Responds to issues autonomously (e.g., low applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🗺️ **How It Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🎯 **Goal Understanding:** Given a high-level objective like \"Hire a Backend Engineer\", the AI understands the intent.\n",
    "* 🧭 **Autonomous Planning:** Creates a full plan (JD → post → screen → interview → onboard).\n",
    "* 🏃‍♂️ **Self-Execution:** Executes the plan using tools + data.\n",
    "* 👁️ **Continuous Monitoring:** Watches progress, identifies problems, adapts (e.g., boosts a job post if applications are low).\n",
    "* 👤 **Human-in-the-Loop:** Seeks human approval at key points, but the AI does the heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🏁 **Result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **proactive, self-directed system** that significantly reduces human workload while keeping the recruiter in control of final decisions.\n"
